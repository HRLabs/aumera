Aumera: Grey Skies and Grim Dawns - a swashbuckling grimdark adventure

-

Designed as a western marches campaign, each game is a contained episode with a single mission. 

Aumera is a humans-only world built on top of a dark secret where abominations and aberrations appear stronger than they should be. 

Players are members of the Away Team (think Star Trek Redshirts) on our Imperial Majesty's Ship LightBringer,
an extension of the Majesty's Will, sent to do the express biddings of Throne. 

S01E00: The Away Team Awaits - basic intro to Aumera in the Crow's Nest, a de-facto NCO tavern
 - starts and ends with a bar fight and intro to 2-3 IMS LightBringer's crew. 
 
S01E01: Obsidian Pointe: Why is this lighthouse so Bright? 
 
S01E02: The Sleepless Fields: Can you capture this flag?

Aumera: Grey Skies and Grim Dawns - a swashbuckling grimdark adventure

-

Designed as a western marches campaign, each game is a contained episode with a single mission. 

Aumera is a humans-only world built on top of a dark secret where abominations and aberrations appear stronger than they should be. 

Players are members of the Away Team (think Star Trek Redshirts) on our Imperial Majesty's Ship LightBringer,
an extension of the Majesty's Will, sent to do the express biddings of Throne. 

S01E00: Awaiting the Away Team - basic intro to Aumera in the Crow's Nest, a de-facto NCO tavern
 - starts and ends with a bar fight and intro to 2-3 IMS LightBringer's crew, and a cliff hanging murder
 
S01E01: Obsidian Pointe: Why is this lighthouse so Bright? 
 
S01E02: Port

NOTE
This module uses AI artwork and free-to-download images.  Also, in the current I've re-used one-or-two maps from a module or two which I have bought.   

I will document those which are re-used and give the source in ARTWORKSOURCE.md file, with URLs or modules.  Consider it as a TODO list to remove and replace with new artwork.

Aumera: BSaGS
Designed as a western marches campaign, each game is a contained episode with a single mission but with an overarching arc that sews them all together. If the players don't take agency in the story, you can use these to drive them back into the arc. 

Aumera is a humans-only world built on top of a dark secret where abominations and aberrations appear more frequent and stronger than they should be.  Players are members of the Away Team (think Star Trek Redshirts) on our Imperial Majesty's Ship LightBringer, an extension of the Majesty's Will, sent to do the express biddings of Throne. Crueler GMs with the trust of their players may want to play this game aggressively and allowing for more PC deaths.

NOTE
This module uses AI artwork and free-to-download images.  Also, in the current I've re-used one-or-two maps from a module or two which I have bought.   

I will document those which are re-used and give the source in ARTWORKSOURCE.md file, with URLs or modules.  Consider it as a TODO list to remove and replace with new artwork.
